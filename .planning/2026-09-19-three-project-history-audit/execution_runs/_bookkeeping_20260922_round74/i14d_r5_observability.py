"""WU-1305: versioned reason taxonomy + privacy-safe metrics collector.

Every rejection/reuse/download/recompute carries a *registered* reason code
(snake_case, versioned by REASON_TAXONOMY_VERSION).  The collector aggregates
by root/route/adapter/version/role without ever recording company names,
document ids, or absolute paths — those are redacted by default (REDACT).

Telemetry export being off must not affect core behavior: the collector is
pure in-memory, append-only, and thread-safe; nothing raises when the
exporter is absent.

ZR-101 (stage taxonomy 2.0): on top of the flat v1.1 reason codes, every
registered reason is attributed to at least one of eight cross-repo stages
(identity, resolution, freshness, acquisition, safety, artifact, semantic,
consumer).  Stage events are validated fail closed: unknown codes/stages are
never silently recorded, and an N-1 consumer that only knows
reason-taxonomy-1.1 rejects a stage-taxonomy-2.0 event with a problems list
instead of crashing.

# ``(?:[A-Za-z0-9]+[_-])*<atom>(?:[_-][A-Za-z0-9]+)*`` was quadratic in the number
# of ``_``/``-`` separated segments (measured: 8000 segments -> 8.9 s, 16000 ->

# (``[A-Za-z0-9_-]+`` still backtracks once per start position when the value

# names such as GITHUB_TOKEN, SLACK_BOT_TOKEN, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY and

#       as wide as the list);
#   r3  one RFC 7235 scheme token, `[A-Za-z]...` (F-REV-R3-01: the after-break
#       quoted alternatives carried an optional-CR form inside a character class,
#       where `?` is a literal member of the negated set);
#   r4  the full RFC 7230 tchar class (F-REV-R3-04: a non-letter-initial scheme
#       leaked where the base tree redacted);
#   r5  THE VALUE-TOKEN CLASS this pattern already uses elsewhere (F-REV-R4-05: a
#       token containing a non-tchar character, e.g. `Bo?t`, leaked too).
# No RFC scheme production is claimed any more.  The scheme word is not what makes
# a header wrap, so restricting this token to scheme-shaped words bought nothing and
# cost a leak each time; the token is now whatever the value grammar calls a token.
# `|` is not in the class because the value delimiter class used everywhere else
# already stops at `|`, so nothing can gain a delimiter by this widening.
# A wrapped header (`Authorization: Bearer` then the secret on the next line) or an
# RFC-7230 obs-fold puts the secret on a line that carries no `key=` prefix, so once
# the pre-break token alone is consumed neither this pattern nor the assignment
# scanner can see it.  Fail CLOSED: after that token and one or more line breaks (a
# blank line included), the next token - or a quoted string reached through the same
# break run - is redacted.  Measured as F-REV-D-01 / F-REV-R2-01 / F-REV-R3-01:
# without this branch the full credential is persisted in the append-only event log.
# Deliberate, registered cost (F-REV-R2-02): it cannot tell a wrapped credential from
# a diagnostic key, so `Authorization: Bearer` + newline DELETES `doc=17`.  The
# breaks are consumed by the match; the indentation and the keys on the lines AFTER
# the redacted one are not.
# One shape stays OPEN and is registered rather than hidden: a TWO-token value that
# then wraps (`Authorization: Bearer abc` + newline + secret).  Closing it needs the
# whole first line consumed as a token run, which deletes `doc=17` from
# `Authorization: Bearer <marker>` + newline + `doc=17` + newline + `stage=` -
# reproduced in `_r3_design_reprobe_20260922/`.  The companion that reproduction
