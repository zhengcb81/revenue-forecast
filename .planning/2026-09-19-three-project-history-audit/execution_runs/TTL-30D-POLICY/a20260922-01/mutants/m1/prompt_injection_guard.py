"""ZR-302: prompt-injection scanner/reviewer receipt lifecycle (guard).

Builds on the FC-905 receipt store (``prompt_injection.py``) with the
missing lifecycle:

- ``scan_text`` — a deterministic injection scanner over a versioned,
  hash-bound ruleset (unknown ruleset hash fails closed).
- ``evaluate_review`` — cache evaluation of a stored receipt against the
  current source bytes and policy ruleset:
    * hit      — receipt valid, source_sha256 + policy_hash match, fresh;
    * ignored  — policy_hash changed (ruleset moved on): not_reviewed,
      never green from a stale ruleset;
    * expired  — reviewed_at older than the TTL: not_reviewed;
    * tampered — source_sha256 mismatch (bytes changed) or malformed
      receipt: not_reviewed (fail closed);
    * absent   — no receipt: not_reviewed.
  ``not_reviewed`` is never faked green: every non-hit path returns
  not_reviewed with an explicit cache_state.

This module is shadow-only on the evaluation side (reads via the
CatalogStore-compatible ``store.fetchone``); receipt generation still goes
through the existing write path in ``prompt_injection``.

Policy surface (TTL-30D-POLICY, owner-ratified OWNER_DECISIONS.md §十九
option A + OPEN-6 ruling C6):

- ``POLICY_RECEIPT_TTL_CAP_SECONDS`` — the policy CAP on the caller's
  ``ttl_seconds``: callers may only TIGHTEN (``ttl_seconds`` > cap raises
  ``PromptInjectionGuardError`` instead of being clamped), and a caller
  ``now`` earlier than the receipt's ``reviewed_at`` is a clock anomaly
  that fails closed as ``tampered`` — a rewound clock can never resurrect
  an expired receipt (``now`` may only make freshness stricter).
- The cap is part of the policy surface covered by ``policy_hash``:
  changing its value is a POLICY CHANGE, and receipts issued under the
  old policy must be invalidated on read exactly as when ``policy_hash``
  moves (OPEN-4 4c: policy content change ⇒ old receipts die).
