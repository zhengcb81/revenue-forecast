# B07 - the read contract's version policy, stated where the contract lives.
#
#   * This interface accepts EXACTLY this version.  An unknown version is
#     refused EXPLICITLY: there is no N-1 rule on either side (that is a
#     cross-repo protocol item, deliberately outside phase B) and no silent
#     downgrade or "best effort" parse.
#   * Failures are expressed with the operation contract's five error values
#     (not_found / not_indexed / unavailable / blocked / ambiguous) plus a
#     reason - never with a new status, and never with a fabricated success.
#   * This interface has NO directory-level fallback: when no qualified copy of
#     the REQUESTED version exists, the answer is an explicit failure
#     (missing / not_found).  It never substitutes another revision, and it never
#     reads a copy outside the configured roots.
#     ONE EXCEPTION, named here because it is a real gap in the sentence above
#     (B-VR07-01): a VERIFIED copy is required for every non-preferred copy, but
#     the preferred one may be served on the catalog's claim (owner decision S-10
#     rule 2: "only when no copy passes verification may ONE row be served on the
#     catalog's declaration").  So "no qualified copy -> explicit failure" holds
#     for *another revision* and for *out-of-root* copies, but a
#     claimed-but-drifted preferred copy is served with an
#     `unverified_<status>_on_pre_b02_canonical` trace entry instead of failing -
#     read this sentence with that exception, and use read_verified_bytes when
#     verified bytes are required.
#
# The consumer-side adapter conversion and the removal of any consumer-side
# `companies` fallback are NOT part of this repository's contract (design B07
# scope table: they belong to phase C).

        Candidates are restricted to the document's own source entry (its
        version), ordered by ``candidate_rank`` (stamped by
        ``service._annotate_locations``), so priority/churn can only decide
        *which copy is tried first* — never *whether a copy qualifies*.

        Serving rule (narrowed twice by independent review: B-VR02-01 then
        B-VR02R2-01/-02):

        1. **a verified copy always wins**: the first candidate whose bytes
           really are the requested version is served, whatever its rank;
        2. only when NO candidate verifies may ONE row be served on the
           catalog's claim: the legacy canonical, provided it is a qualified
           candidate of the document's own version.  The reason records why
           that row failed (``unverified_<status>_on_pre_b02_canonical``) and
           the per-candidate diagnostics are in ``tried`` — never silent.
           **Documented differences from pre-B02** (S-10): pre-B02 matched
           ``.rejections`` as a substring and did not restrict the election to
           the document's own source group, so the claim-trusted row is *not*
           bit-for-bit the row pre-B02 would have served — it is that row
           minus two defects (segment matching instead of substring, own
           version only);
        3. **every other copy needs verified bytes**; otherwise the answer is
           no handle at all (unavailable -> MISSING), which is what keeps

        Serving the bytes means: read the file once, digest exactly the buffer
        that is returned, compare it with the requested version's
        ``content_sha256``, and only then hand the buffer over.  A copy that is
        served on the catalog's claim (the pre-B02 trust level kept for the
        preferred copy by decision S-10) therefore cannot leak drifted bytes
        through this entry point: its digest will not match, and the answer is
        an explicit ``unavailable`` with reason ``content_sha256_mismatch``.

        Scope note, stated precisely: this is the gate for callers that ask this
        resolver for bytes.  A consumer that keeps opening
        ``SourceHandle.canonical_path`` by itself still bypasses it — replacing
        those call sites is the versioned read contract's job (B07), not this
        step's, so B03 delivers the primitive plus its acceptance and registers
        the wiring as B07's.

        Refusals before any read: a locator that resolves outside the configured
        roots (``not_found`` / ``artifact_path_outside_allowed_root`` - the
        registered taxonomy code for a path outside the allowed roots) and a cloud
        placeholder whose bytes are not local
        (``unavailable`` / ``placeholder_not_hydrated`` — opening it would
        download).  Refusals during the read: interruption (``read_failed``),
        the size ceiling (``exceeds_candidate_cap``), a size or mtime change
        (``changed_during_read``) and caller cancellation (``cancelled``).

        Passing the request's ``_ReadBudget`` keeps the per-request resource
        ceiling and cancellation semantics of ``resolve``; without one the byte
        cap still applies.

        ``expected_content_sha256`` is PINNED to the handle (B-VR03-01): it may
        only repeat the version the handle already names.  Anything else is
        refused, because otherwise the result would carry one version's
        ``document_id`` next to another version's bytes and digest while calling
        itself verified - the same fail-closed rule ``reader.resolve_handle``
        and ``reader.bundle`` apply to this parameter.
