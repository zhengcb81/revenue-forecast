"""Publication receipts for formal revenue forecast output.

A publication receipt certifies that a forecast result has passed the
self-contained output validator.  Since the receipt is only issued from a
verification context produced by ``validate_published_forecast`` (the strong,
input-required entry), a weakly-validated or forged artifact cannot obtain a
valid receipt.

Design rules (task_plan.md Phase 2 / Phase 6 A1):

* ``result_sha256`` continues to cover the whole result (including this receipt),
  so existing tamper/rehash contracts are unchanged.
* ``validated_payload_sha256`` excludes both ``result_sha256`` and
  ``publication_receipt`` so the receipt never references itself (no recursion /
  non-determinism).
* ``gate_ids`` reflect the gates that actually executed during strong
  validation (see ``expected_publication_gates``), never a fixed claim.
* ``verification_context_sha256`` binds the receipt to the exact
  ``VerificationContext`` returned by ``validate_published_forecast``; the
  validator recomputes it so a receipt built from a weaker or fabricated
  context is rejected.
* This module never re-runs the revenue model — it only hashes and validates.

SECURITY BOUNDARY (B1 / REM-02): two different things live in this module.

* ``validate_publication_receipt`` is a **hash-consistency check on one artifact**
  and **NOT a security boundary** (see its docstring and
  :class:`PublicationReceiptOnlyWarning`).
* ``validate_forecast_output`` in :mod:`revenue_report` is the consumer entry
  point: it re-runs the bounded input-gated recomputations and the attestation
  binding.  **Consumers must call ``validate_forecast_output``**, never
  ``validate_publication_receipt`` alone.

Attestation (B1 / REM-01): a receipt claiming ``attestation_status ==
"host_signed"`` must carry a ``publication_attestation`` binding record that
verifies against the trust domain, per I-08-A E27 (``attestation_missing_record``).
The label is never accepted on set membership.

    What this function does **NOT** check, and cannot: whether the artifact is

    itself or a public, non-secret hash, so an artifact whose values and hashes
    were all recomputed together after a mutation satisfies every comparison.
