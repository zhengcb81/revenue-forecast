"""R4 phase-B step B03 acceptance: stable read bytes ("serve the verified
version's bytes or fail explicitly").

Design §B03, with the rule list of
``assurance/runs/2026-09-11_r4-phase-b/evidence/b03-plan.md`` (section 2):

* the file is read ONCE and the digest is computed over **exactly the buffer
  that is returned**, so "the bytes are the verified bytes" holds by
  construction — checking a path and then letting the caller open it again
  cannot promise that (B-DR-07: on Windows a shared-mode open only arbitrates at
  open time);
* the **preferred** copy is subject to the same gate.  B02 serves it on the
  catalog's claim (decision S-10, "the byte-level hard gate belongs to B03's
  read path"), so a drifted preferred copy must be refused *here*;
* every refusal is one of the contract's five error values
  (``operation-contract.md`` §2.4) plus a human-readable reason — resource
  ceilings and cancellation are NOT states;
* nothing is served from a cloud placeholder (no implicit hydration), nothing
  outside the configured roots (no symlink escape / stale absolute path), and
  never a partial buffer.

Matrix items: L05, L06 (phase-B acceptance map, reverse-coverage
section; step B03 claims these, and the cases below are what exercises them).

Product code is NOT modified by this file (file-scope F10: new tests only).
