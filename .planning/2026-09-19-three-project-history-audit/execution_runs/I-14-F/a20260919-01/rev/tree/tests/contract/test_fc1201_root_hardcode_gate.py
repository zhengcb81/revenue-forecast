"""FC-1201 RED/acceptance tests: root/source hardcode gate ratchet + cleanup.

SCENARIO: EX-08

Interpretation A (user decision 2026-08-12): the FC-304
``no_root_specific_hardcode`` gate is turned into a *frozen ratchet* — the
allowlist of legacy/root-specific owners is pinned to a baseline so no NEW
file can join it without a deliberate, reviewed test update.  The v1 scanner
branches stay allowlisted as the bounded R9 cutover backlog (plan §3 step7:
delete legacy code only after the legacy bridge is off).  Files whose only
token mention was a comment/docstring are cleaned so they can leave the
allowlist (real shrink, zero behavior change).

This FC does NOT touch the v1 scanner, the production config loader, the
write path, or production yaml (canonical_writer/cli refactors are deferred
to an FC-1201 follow-up — they require a loader change, out of scope for a
"safe cleanup" FC).
