"""FC-906-b RED/GREEN: role-applicability contract (markdown / consumer_analysis).

FC-906-a proved the 3 registered producers now emit v2-bindable artifacts.
This contract pins the other half of the FC-906 role matrix: the catalog side
has NO producer for ``markdown`` (redundant with ``normalized``, which is
already text/markdown) and ``consumer_analysis`` (consumer-side provenance
contract per E2E-D06) — both documented in
``assurance/fc/FC-906/03_change_contract_fc906b.md`` and never written by
catalog producers.  The role contract document itself is the RED target
(missing -> test fails), then the guard pins the invariant forever.
