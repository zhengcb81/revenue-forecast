"""R4 phase-B step B02 acceptance: same-version candidate selection.

B02 makes "which copy of the requested version do we reuse" a four-segment
decision — (1) root registration/capability, (2) status and safety, (3)
locally readable bytes, (4) preference order — where segments 1-2 decide
*qualification* and segment 4 may only decide *which qualified copy is tried
first*.  Before B02 the canonical location was elected by priority alone and
the resolver then discarded it if it was unhealthy or rejected, so a document
with a perfectly good second copy could be reported as missing (and trigger a
re-download).

Acceptance covered here (see assurance/.../test-acceptance-map.md):

  L01/L02  four roots, identical bytes, one document: the canonical copy is
           elected inside the QUALIFIED set; config (root) order changes
           nothing.
  L03      withdrawal fall-through: the preferred copy disappears -> the same
           version is served from the next qualified copy, the reference
           (document id + content hash) is unchanged and no download is
           requested; all copies gone -> unavailable with no reuse.
  L04      provider-rejected (.rejections) paths are excluded BEFORE ordering,
           even when they hold the best priority and their document row was
           forced back to active.
  budget   B02 read budget/cancellation: finite candidate/byte ceilings,
           cancellation never reads a byte, and neither is ever silent.
  no-net   a candidate whose bytes are not local (cloud placeholder) is
           refused without reading it: the query path performs no network I/O.

Scope note (B02, rev5): the serving rule is exactly two clauses, and the cases
below pin both:

  1. **a verified copy always wins** — the first candidate whose bytes really
     are the requested version is served, whatever its rank (so withdrawing or
     corrupting the preferred copy still yields the same version from another
     copy);
  2. only when NO candidate verifies may ONE row be served on the catalog's
     claim: the legacy ``is_canonical`` row among the qualified candidates of
     the document's own version.  It is never silent (the reason is
     ``unverified_<status>_on_pre_b02_canonical`` and the per-candidate reasons
     are in the debug trace).

Clause 2 is NOT equivalent to what pre-B02 served.  The authoritative list of
the deliberate differences — (a) ``.rejections`` matched as a path SEGMENT
instead of a substring (wider on names such as ``my.rejections_backup``),
(b) the election restricted to the document's own source group (conditionally;
stricter), (c) the row must additionally pass the local probe, so a cloud
placeholder is refused where pre-B02 only checked ``is_file()`` (stricter) — is
maintained in ONE place and must not be restated here:

  revenue-forecast/assurance/runs/2026-09-11_r4-phase-b/evidence/
      b02-implementation.md   section 3  (decision S-10)

A-side frozen fixtures (determinism / sql pushdown) build catalogs whose files
deliberately do not contain the bytes their metadata claims, which is why
clause 2 exists at all; clause 1 is a strict improvement over pre-B02.

Matrix items: L01, L02, L03, L04 (phase-B acceptance map, reverse-coverage
section; step B02 claims these, and the cases below are what exercises them).

Product code is NOT modified by this file (file-scope F10: new tests only).
